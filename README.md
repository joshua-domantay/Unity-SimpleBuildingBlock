## Introduction
This Unity project is a simple building block application where the user can place different objects within a given area. The user can choose to place a cube, a sphere, or a capsule. In addition to the type of object being placed, the user can also choose between three different texture or material. Placement of an object is done with the mouse left click. If the user wants to remove an object from the scene, they can simply hover on that object and press right click. This will play an animation that explodes the object. This application can be described as a much simpler version to the popular video game, Minecraft.
