# Unity-SimpleBuildingBlock
COMP 565 Advanced Computer Graphics project. This Unity project is a simple building block application where the user can place different objects within a given area. The user has three options: a cube, a sphere, and a capsule. In addition to the type of object being placed, the user can also choose between three different textures. I describe this project as a simpler version to the popular video game, Minecraft.

## Controls
Left mouse click: Place object<br>
Right mouse click: Remove an object. Removing an object will play an explode animation
